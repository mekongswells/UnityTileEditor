UnityTileEditor
===============

Tile Editor for Unity

Setup:

-Import the .unitypackage

-Create 3 Tags: "LayersParent", "Tiles", "Disabled"

-Move the Test-Tileset to assets/resources/tilesets (this will get created once the scripts compile)

How-to:

Once the script compiles there's a new toggle in the Sceneview, everything should be self-explanatory.

To load a Map, call MapLoader.LoadMap(mapName)

That should be it.
